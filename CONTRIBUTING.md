# Contributing 🤝✨

This repo’s basically my playground—a staging zone for testing updates and new ideas before they head to the real party. If you’ve got something awesome to add, contribute it where the community gathers:

👉 **[github/awesome-copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot)**

That’s where all Copilot resources, guides, and experiments live in one place. This repo just helps make sure everything works before it lands there. 🚀
