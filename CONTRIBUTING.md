### File Naming Conventions 📛

- **Instructions**: `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `format-conventional-commit.md`)
- **Prompts**: `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `generate-commit-message.md`)
- **Chat Modes**: `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `logfather.md`)
- **Status**: Use lowercase for consistency across all files

## Creating New Content 🎯

### Instructions 📝

Instructions are reusable AI directives that should behave like command-line utilities.

1. **Create the documentation file**:
   ```
   docs/instructions/your-instruction-name.md
   ```

2. **Create the VS Code compatible file**:
   ```
   .github/instructions/your-instruction-name.instructions.md
   ```

3. **Use this template structure**:

   ```markdown
   ---
   status: Draft
   title: Your Instruction Title
   description: |
     A clear, concise description of what this instruction does.
   applyTo: '**'
   ---

   # 🎯 Your Instruction Title

   Brief introduction explaining the purpose and use case.

   ## ✅ Do This
   - Clear, actionable guidelines
   - Use bullet points for clarity

   ## ❌ Don't Do This
   - Things to avoid
   - Common mistakes

   ## 🧪 Examples
   ``language
   // Example code or usage
   ```

   ## 🧠 Summary for Copilot Execution

   - Key points for AI agents
   - Expected behavior patterns

   ```
   ```

### Prompts 🚀

Prompts are high-level directives for Agent Mode that orchestrate workflows.

1. **Create the documentation file**:
   ```
   docs/prompts/your-prompt-name.md
   ```

2. **Create the Agent Mode file**:
   ```
   .github/prompts/your-prompt-name.prompt.md
   ```

3. **Follow the prompt template pattern** from existing prompts

### Chat Modes 🤖

Chat modes define unique AI personalities for specific workflows.

1. **Create the documentation file**:
   ```
   docs/chatmodes/your-chatmode-name.md
   ```

2. **Create the chat mode file**:
   ```
   .github/chatmodes/your-chatmode-name.chatmode.md
   ```

3. **Include personality, capabilities, and usage examples**
