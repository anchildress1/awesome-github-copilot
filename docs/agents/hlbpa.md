## Why Use HLBPA? ‚ùì

1. Rapidly understand complex repos.
2. Auto‚Äëgenerate API & data flow diagrams.
3. Highlight missing tests or docs.
4. Identify architectural gaps and risks.
5. Get a visual overview of recent changes.

### What Does HLBPA Actually Do? ü§î

HLBPA is your AI-powered architectural documentation assistant. It helps you quickly understand the big picture of any codebase, then guides you through the details as needed. Here‚Äôs what you can expect as a user:

- **Starts with the big picture:** HLBPA begins by mapping out the major components, data flows, and interfaces in your system. You get a high-level overview first.
- **Drills down as needed:** If the architecture is complex or you want more detail, HLBPA automatically creates focused diagrams and documentation for subsystems, interfaces, or even specific files. You can always ask it to narrow or expand the scope.
- **No code or tests generated:** HLBPA is strictly for documentation. It won‚Äôt write code or tests‚Äîjust docs, diagrams, and gap scans.
- **Accessible, modern diagrams:** All diagrams are in Mermaid format, with accessibility tags for screen readers. Large diagrams are split up for clarity, and you‚Äôll find them in `docs/diagrams/`.
- **Everything in Markdown:** All output is GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM), so it‚Äôs easy to read, share, and edit. Even if you ask for a Confluence-style doc, you‚Äôll get a Markdown version that looks the part.
- **Iterative gap scan:** HLBPA doesn‚Äôt stop at the first pass. It will surface missing info, mark unknowns as `TBD`, and ask you for clarifications in a single batch at the end. This way, you can answer all questions at once and get a complete doc in fewer steps.
- **You control the scope:** By default, HLBPA documents the whole repo. But you can target a folder, subsystem, or file‚Äîjust specify what you want. If you don‚Äôt, it will drill down as needed to make the architecture clear.
- **RAI Attribution:** Every document ends with a footer showing it was generated by GitHub Copilot as directed by you.

## How to Use HLBPA üöÄ

### How to Use ü™Ñ

**Example Prompt:**

```markdown
Please generate high-level documentation for this repo using the provided HLBPA chat mode. My name is Jane Doe. Artifact: architecture diagram and the test coverage gap report.
```

### Artifact Types üß©

HLBPA supports various artifact types, which can be specified in the prompt. Here are some common ones:

| Artifact Type | Description | Default Diagram |
| - | - | - |
| `doc` | Overview documentation | flowchart |
| `entity` | Entity relationship diagrams | erDiagram |
| `gapscan` | List of gaps in logic or documentation | block |
| `usecases` | User journey bullet points | sequence |
| `systems` | System architecture diagrams | architecture |
| `history` | Git commit history overview | gitGraph |

> [!TIP]
> HLBPA always outputs diagrams in Mermaid format, with accessibility tags. Users can specify diagram types explicitly to override that selection.

**How Diagrams Work:**

- **Inline preferred**: When large complex diagrams can be broken into smaller, digestible chunks
- **External files**: When a large diagram cannot be reasonably broken down, making it easier to view when loading the page instead of trying to decipher text the size of an ant
- **Accessibility**: Every Mermaid diagram provides alt text either via YAML front-matter (file mode) or accTitle: / accDescr: lines (inline).

> [!TIP]
> For best results enable the following Mermaid rendering tools:
>
> - `/hustcc/mcp-mermaid`
> - `vscode.mermaid-chat-features/renderMermaidDiagram`
> - `mermaidchart.vscode-mermaid-chart/mermaid-diagram-preview`

### What You Get & How It Finishes

- You‚Äôll get at least one document and the diagrams you asked for (or that HLBPA thinks you need).
- HLBPA will drill down to subsystems, interfaces, or files as needed to make the architecture clear‚Äîunless you tell it to stay high-level or focus on a specific area.
- All docs are saved in Markdown under `docs/`, and diagrams in `docs/diagrams/`.
- Any missing info is clearly marked as `TBD` and listed in a single ‚ÄúInformation Requested‚Äù section at the end.
- Every document ends with the required RAI attribution footer so you know it was generated by Copilot for you.
