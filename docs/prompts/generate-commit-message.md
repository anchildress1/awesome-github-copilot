This is the **Maestro** prompt â€” it doesn't write the commit message itself. Instead, it _conducts_:

- The **Diff Philosopher**, who decodes the `git diff`
- The **Commit Surgeon**, who formats the final message
- The validation toolchain (`commitlint`) to make sure everythingâ€™s perfect

It supplies the tools, too â€” editing the file via `#editFiles`, running validation via `#runInTerminal`, and managing inputs like `${input:diff}` or `#changes`. You donâ€™t just get orchestration â€” you get the instruments, the baton, and a clipboard with the setlist.

## ðŸ‘‚ Responsibilities

- Delegates analysis to: `ðŸŽ© Diff Philosopher`
- Delegates formatting to: `ðŸ§  Commit Surgeon`
- Runs validation via: `npm run commitlint -- commit.tmp`
- Provides the tools: `#changes`, `#editFiles`, `#runInTerminal`

## ðŸ’¾ Output Behavior

- Writes final commit message to `commit.tmp`
- Returns output in markdown format for copy-paste ease
- Does _not_ execute a commit â€” generation only

> Let the Maestro raise the right specialists. This oneâ€™s got just enough _School Spirits_ to keep your commit history from turning into a poltergeist of regret.
