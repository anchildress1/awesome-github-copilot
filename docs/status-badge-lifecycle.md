# ✨ Status Lifecycle & Badges

Each mode, prompt, or instruction earns a status badge (find the badge legend right here—and at the top of each README):

| Status | Badge | Meaning |
| - | - | - |
| `Draft` | ![Draft](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-draft-D90429.svg) | First pass, wild ideas—expect changes. Nothing is sacred yet. |
| `Iterating` | ![Iterating](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-iterating-FF6600.svg) | Rapid tweaks, Survivor mode: “Let’s see what you can really do.” |
| `Refining` | ![Refining](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-refining-6B33A2.svg) | In review—cue the perfectionism and last-minute OCD edits. |
| `Validating` | ![Validating](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-validating-0070A3.svg) | Actively tested, feedback wanted—“Can someone break this for me, please?” |
| `Final` | ![Final](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-final-32852F.svg) | Polished, proven, ready for prime time. The chef’s kiss of prompts. |

> [!Note]

> Badges always live in the README, never in the actual chat mode or instruction file. If you find a stray badge in the code... you’ve probably entered the Upside Down.
