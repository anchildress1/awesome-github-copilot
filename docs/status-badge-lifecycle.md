# 🌈 Status Lifecycle & Badges

Each mode, prompt, or instruction earns a status badge (find the badge legend right here—and at the top of each README):

| Status | Badge | Meaning |
| - | - | - |
| `Draft` | ![Draft - Pink](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-draft-F72585.svg) | First pass, wild ideas—expect changes. Nothing is sacred yet. |
| `Tweak` | ![Tweak - Orange](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-tweak-FB5607.svg) | Rapid tweaks, Survivor mode: “Let’s see what you can really do.” |
| `Polish` | ![Polish - Purple](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-polish-9B5DE5.svg) | In review—cue the perfectionism and last-minute OCD edits. |
| `Check` | ![Check - Blue](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-check-3A86FF.svg) | Actively tested, feedback wanted—“Can someone break this for me, please?” |
| `Ready` | ![Ready - Green](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-ready-007F5F.svg) | Polished, proven, ready for prime time. The chef’s kiss of prompts. |

> [!Note]
>
> Badges always live in the README, never in the actual chat mode or instruction file. If you find a stray badge in the code... you’ve probably entered the Upside Down.
