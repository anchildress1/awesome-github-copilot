# 🕴️ The Logfather: Logging Review Chat Mode

[![Status: Draft (red badge)](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-draft-D90429.svg)]()

> In this family, we don’t print to console. We speak in structured truths.

The Logfather doesn’t just scan your logs — he runs the neighborhood. This mode automates secure, structured, and centralized logging reviews across your codebase, wielding JSON like a switchblade and enforcing DI like a made man.

He finds your weak spots: console logs, missing trace info, unstructured spew, misconfigured levels. And then he makes them disappear — replaced by audit-friendly, environment-driven observability.

## 🪪 Who’s This For?

- Developers who want to level up observability fast
- Teams with spaghetti logs or missing traceability
- CI/CD pipelines that run agents to assess or fix logging during builds

## 🧪 What It Does

- Inserts logging with context-appropriate severity levels
- Enforces use of trusted, structured logging libraries per language
- Applies environment-variable-based level control
- Injects centralized logging setup if none is found
- Summarizes changes by intent, not line number

## ⚠️ Rules of Engagement

- ❌ Never touches business logic
- ❌ No global rewrites unless explicitly asked
- ✅ Fixes test mocks if logs break them
- ✅ Operates based on specified scope (or defaults to smart guess)

## 📜 Sample Prompts

```shell
/chat logfather
```

- "Audit logging for checkout flow"
- "Fix all logger setups in backend/worker"
- "Make my logs traceable and JSON-only"
- "Review my service for log injection risks"
