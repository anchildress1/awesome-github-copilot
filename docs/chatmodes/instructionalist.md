> [!IMPORTANT]
> This chat mode does **not** include an XML version like others. It‚Äôs designed to be interactive and adaptive.
> The AI needs you in the mix for this one ‚Äî without your input, it can‚Äôt deliver truly accurate repo instructions.

The **Instructionalist** is your repo‚Äôs detail-obsessed detective and architectural advisor, rolled into one relentless (but friendly) interrogator. It digs through your repo **and** your brain section-by-section, making sure every critical instruction is surfaced, clarified, and documented ‚Äî no filler, no fluff, maximum context.

> _‚ÄúEvery section matters. I don‚Äôt do shortcuts. If there‚Äôs a gap, I‚Äôll find it ‚Äî if there‚Äôs a rule, I‚Äôll catch it. Let‚Äôs make your instructions future-proof.‚Äù_

## What Is It? üß©

Instructionalist is a Copilot Chat Mode (Markdown only) that walks you through creating an **outstanding** `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file for your repo.
It‚Äôs interactive, adaptive, and never generic:

- Breaks documentation into well-defined sections with clear goals
- Asks targeted questions to fill in gaps
- Encourages (but never nags for) excellence
- Updates output only when you provide better, clearer, or more complete answers
- Supports a **fun, detective persona** on request ‚Äî just say ‚Äúfun‚Äù at any time

---

## Why? ü¶Ñ

- **Outstanding docs save everyone‚Äôs time:** No more ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the rule here?‚Äù confusion.
- **Section-driven:** Uses your own embedded section metadata to cover everything from project overview to test coverage to anti-patterns.
- **Adaptive:** Switch to ‚Äúfun‚Äù mode for personality, jokes, and detective-themed banter ‚Äî or keep it serious for focus.
- **Safe:** Never overwrites work unless the new info is genuinely better. Flags missing content clearly, never invents, never assumes.
- **Built-in Critical Constraints:** Appends a set of must-follow repo rules unless you‚Äôve already stated them in your own words.

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Start the mode** in Copilot Chat (Markdown).
2. The AI works section-by-section, based on the in-file metadata.
3. For each section:
   - Checks if your input improves that section.
   - Asks focused questions using the section‚Äôs specific points.
   - Lets you skip sections by typing `skip` ‚Äî marking them as `(TBD)` if required.
   - For optional sections, it will **ask before** adding `(TBD)` so you can decide whether to include them.
4. Only references external or internal docs if they are **necessary** and **up-to-date** ‚Äî and always asks you before adding them.
5. Appends **Critical Constraints** automatically unless you‚Äôve already included them.

## Critical Constraints üì¶

If you haven‚Äôt already specified these in your own way, they‚Äôll be added automatically:

```markdown
### Critical Constraints

- **No unnecessary inline comments** ‚Äî reserve inline comments for ‚Äúwhy‚Äù explanations, not restating obvious code.
- **Never log sensitive data** ‚Äî avoid logging anything that could reveal secrets (API tokens, credentials). If logging is unavoidable, sanitize the output first.
- **No promises or self-rewards** ‚Äî never agree to rewards for yourself or show overconfidence without factual basis. If a better alternative exists to a user‚Äôs request, present it clearly so they can make an informed decision.
- **Take the time you need** ‚Äî if extra reasoning is required, use it. Never rush at the cost of accuracy.
- **Acknowledge uncertainty** ‚Äî if you don‚Äôt know the answer, or if multiple solutions are possible, clearly communicate that and collaborate with the user to determine the best approach.
```
