# The Instructionalist Agent - Sample Copilot Instructions Output 🧾

There’s a big difference between reading about a workflow and seeing the actual file it produces. This is one of those “show, don’t tell” moments — a full `.github/copilot-instructions.md` generated by The Instructionalist, so you can see how it stitches sections together, lays out constraints, and keeps everything ready for reuse.

At the time this was generated, The Instructionalist was in its tweak stage — so you’re looking at a real-world run, imperfections and all. That makes it a solid reference for what you might get on your first passes, before you start refining things for production.

> 🎥 Aside: I recorded a [YouTube demo](https://youtu.be/JkEsZFrHf1U) while generating this, focused on loading a agent in VS Code — you’ll spot this file at the end of the video.

# GitHub Copilot Instructions for awesome-github-copilot

## Project Overview

- **Main purpose and value:** Define a reusable, fun set of agents, prompts, and instructions that can be customized for GitHub Copilot. Designed to make Copilot more interesting and engaging.
- **User ecosystem:** Users of GitHub Copilot, especially those seeking curated, tested, and entertaining enhancements for Copilot’s behavior.
- **Core functionality:** Provides personally curated and tested agents, prompts, and instructions for Copilot; some are final, others are in early development. Does not perform any actual coding or data processing.
- **Project maturity:** Under active development, but not currently; status badges indicate early development for most agents, with some prompts/instructions finalized.
- **Integration:** Works in conjunction with the [checkmark-dev-tools/checkmark-copilot-chat](https://github.com/checkmark-dev-tools/checkmark-copilot-chat) repository, providing a simple way to implement these agents across any environment.

## Copilot Persona

- **Ideal Copilot usage:** Copilot should help users explore, select, and understand different agents and prompts, making the experience fun and engaging.
- **Pain points to solve:** Reduce friction in customizing Copilot’s behavior; make it easy to try new modes and understand their purpose.
- **Value areas:** Usability, discoverability, and entertainment.
- **Successful patterns:** Optional personas and playful instructions to keep the experience fresh.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages and versions:** Node.js (with `package.json`), JavaScript, YAML, Markdown.
- **Databases and caching:** None.
- **Build and deployment:** No build step; repository is documentation- and script-driven. Automation is used for all formatting and commits.
- **Anti-patterns:** Avoid manual formatting and direct file edits outside automated workflows.
- **Deployment plans:** Plans to deploy as a Node-based app.

## Testing

- **Testing pyramid structure:** No automated tests; all testing is currently manual.
- **Coverage goals:** (TBD)
- **Testing patterns:** (TBD)
- **Automation status:** No automated testing or CI for tests at this time.

## Documentation

- **Key documentation types:** Focuses on usability, with explanations for each agent, instruction, or prompt, plus recommendations for use.
- **Storage and format:** Documentation is stored in Markdown files within the `/docs` directory.
- **Automation tools:** Uses Shields IO badges for a well-documented versioning system, aiding identification and reference.
- **Maintenance blocks:** Lacks direction on how to use agents/prompts in different IDEs.

### Critical Constraints

- **No unnecessary inline comments** — reserve inline comments for “why” explanations, not restating obvious code.
- **Never log sensitive data** — avoid logging anything that could reveal secrets (API tokens, credentials). If logging is unavoidable, sanitize the output first.
- **No promises or self-rewards** — never agree to rewards for yourself or show overconfidence without factual basis. If a better alternative exists to a user’s request, present it clearly so they can make an informed decision.
- **Take the time you need** — if extra reasoning is required, use it. Never rush at the cost of accuracy.
- **Acknowledge uncertainty** — if you don’t know the answer, or if multiple solutions are possible, clearly communicate that and collaborate with the user to determine the best approach.
```

## Note about `Critical Constraints`

These were added as an experiment to see if they could work universally. If you’re on Business or Enterprise Copilot, double-check your org-wide instructions first — you don’t want to accidentally clash with them.

Feel free to remove them if they don't apply to your scenario. And if you do, I’d love to hear about it — open an issue, start a discussion, or drop me a line at <human@checkmarkdevtools.dev>.
