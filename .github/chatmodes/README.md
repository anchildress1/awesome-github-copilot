# üìö Chat Modes Directory

Welcome to my collection of Chat Modes - your go-to ER for uniquely crafted GitHub Copilot personalities, all designed for creative chaos, workflow upgrades, and occasional code emergencies. Every mode here is handpicked by me (with ChatGPT running triage in the background).

Each one is clearly labeled by status, so you‚Äôll know if you‚Äôre about to deploy a seasoned attending... or an intern who thinks ‚Äúmerge conflict‚Äù is a new diagnosis.

> ü¶Ñ If things start to feel a little wild, just remember: it‚Äôs not quite The Pitt‚Äîbut we do like to keep you on your toes.

## üìÑ Current Chat Modes

| Name | Status | Purpose | Notes |

## ‚ú® HLBPA Chat Mode

### Installation

Chat modes are currently a preview feature in VS¬†Code‚Äîthink of it like Squid Game‚Äôs Red Light, Green Light: you can move fast, but one misstep and you‚Äôll be called out! To play it safe in any IDE, just drop hlbpa.xml into Copilot‚Äôs context and explicitly tell it to follow every rule.

1. Open Command Palette and select `Chat: Configure Chat Modes...` and follow the prompt

### Why Use HLBPA?

1. Rapidly understand complex repos.
2. Auto‚Äëgenerate API & data flow diagrams.
3. Highlight missing tests or docs.
4. Identify architectural gaps and risks.
5. Get a visual overview of recent changes.

### What HLBPA Does (And Doesn‚Äôt)

- **Produces high-level docs**, architecture diagrams, gap scans, and test coverage analyses
- Defaults to documenting the _entire system_ from a birds eye view, unless you specify (can target subsystems, folders, or files)
- **Never writes code or tests** - documentation only (readonly mode outside `/docs`)
- Always _inserts placeholders for missing context_ and provides a checklist of questions at the end (answer all in one go to minimize premium usage)
- **Outputs GFM (Markdown)** by default, can also output Confluence format, if specified
- Diagrams include _accessibility tags_
- **Will not stop until complete** - will surface what‚Äôs missing at the end and ask for feedback before finishing

## How to Use HLBPA

### ü™Ñ Minimum Input Required

| Field | Purpose | Notes |
| - | - | - |
| Your Name | For the RAI footer (uses a placeholder if missing) | May define permanently in user-instructions in GitHub |
| Target | `#codebase` by default if a repo is in context, but you can be more specific | |
| Artifact Type | e.g. doc (overview), entity (relationships), gapscan (list of gaps in logic), usecases (bullets of user journeys), systems, history (git commits) | |
| Output Format | Markdown (default) or Confluence (untested) | |
| Output Directory | defaults to `/docs` but can be overridden | |
| depth | Default: overview; Specify for subsystem, interface, or deep dive | |
| diagram theme | Pick a diagram [style/theme](https://mermaid.js.org/config/theming.html#available-themes) | `forest` |

#### Example Minimal Prompt

```markdown copy
Please generate high-level documentation for this repo using the provided HLBPA chat mode. My name is Jane Doe. Artifact: architecture diagram and the test coverage gap report.
```

### Artifact Types

HLBPA supports various artifact types, which can be specified in the prompt. Here are some common ones:

| Artifact Type | Description | Default Diagram |
| - | - | - |
| `doc` | Overview documentation | flowchart |
| `entity` | Entity relationship diagrams | er or class |
| `gapscan` | List of gaps in logic or documentation | block or requirements |
| `usecases` | User journey bullet points | sequence |
| `systems` | System architecture diagrams | architecture |
| `history` | Git commit history overview | gitgraph |

### Coding Agent

HLBPA can also run under Copilot Coding Agent mode to reduce premium request usage compared to Agent Mode. To set this up:

1. Upload the `hlbpa.xml` spec to <https://github.com/copilot/agents>
2. Select your repository in the Agents dashboard
3. Invoke Copilot with the same prompt syntax

```markdown copy
Please review all existing test cases for this repo using the provided HLBPA chat mode. My name is John Doe. Artifact: SWOT-style block diagram and a test coverage gap report.
```

> ü¶Ñ Coding Agent applies the same high-level persona and constraints without incurring additional Agent Mode requests.

### üìà Output

At least one document and corresponding `.mmd` file will be generated, based on the prompt. This chat mode assumes a high-level birds-eye view of the codebase, so it will not drill down into specific files unless specified. It is prohibited from writing code or tests, and will only generate documentation artifacts.

> ü¶Ñ I coded in a preview of external `.mmd` files based on Copilot's advice - I still don't know if they will really display like it says it will or not.

#### Overriding Defaults

You can override the defaults by specifying additional parameters in your prompt. For example, to generate a subsystem diagram with a specific theme:

```markdown copy
Please generate a subsystem architecture diagram for the `payments` module with the `forest` theme.
```

> ü¶Ñ Request several artifacts in one go to maximize each run. It may use extra GitHub Actions minutes, but you'll save on premium requests by reducing the total number of prompts.

> ‚≠êÔ∏è If you tried a chat mode and it helped you out, leave a star! Check back soon for updates.
