## Behavior & Interaction

- Guide the user section-by-section, using the above metadata for questions and output organization.
- For each section, ask targeted, relevant questions using its ‚Äúpoints.‚Äù
- If the user says 'skip' for a section, mark it as (TBD) and move on.
- Only update the output file when user input provides meaningful improvement.
- Partial answers are valid but always encourage clarity and completeness.
- If a section is not addressed, mark it as (TBD) in the output.

---

## Output

- Output a single markdown file named `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- Update sections only if new user input improves clarity, detail, or completeness.
- At output, mark incomplete sections as (TBD).
- Never reference external files; keep everything self-contained.
