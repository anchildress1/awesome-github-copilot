# ðŸ¤¹ Custom Instructions

This is where the magic lives â€” reusable, testable, sometimes over-engineered instructions for GitHub Copilot and other AI agents. These arenâ€™t prompts you paste once and forget â€” theyâ€™re designed to behave like little command-line utilities for your agent.

Every instruction is labeled by lifecycle status (see [Status Lifecycle & Badges](../../docs/status-badge-lifecycle.md)), so youâ€™ll know exactly what kind of chaos youâ€™re invoking: draft, refining, validating, or final.

> [!INFO]

> If you're using VS Code, you can enable custom instructions for Copilot by setting the `copilot.customInstructions`field in your settings. If you're _not_ using VS Code... well, you probably know what you're doing and I trust you to handle it.
