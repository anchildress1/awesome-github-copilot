# Security Policy 🔒

## Found a Security Issue? 🕵️‍♀️

Look, we're all adults here. If you’ve managed to find a security vulnerability in a repo full of Copilot prompts and markdown files... first of all, **congratulations, digital Sherlock**! Second, please don’t weaponize my emoji usage. 🫠

## Reporting Process 📮

**DO NOT** open a public issue. I really don’t need the entire internet gossiping about the fact that someone figured out how to hack my carefully crafted and well planned AI sitcom series.

Instead, send your findings privately to: **📧 <human@checkmarkdevtools.dev>**

### What to Include 📋

- A clear, friendly description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (bonus points for screenshots and memes)
- The severity level *you* think it deserves (I reserve final judgment ⚖️)
- Any suggested fixes — I promise to read them... eventually. I might even seriously consider one.

## Response Timeline ⏱️

I’ll always respond **soon-ish**. That’s my official SLA. Could be hours, could be days — I operate on asynchronous time only. Sometimes incoming messages are delayed by things beyond my control (and also ones within my control, but I choose spontaneous randomness instead). 🌀

## What Counts as a Security Issue? 🤔

Honestly? In a repo full of Copilot instructions and chat modes, the line’s a bit fuzzy. But here are some solid contenders:

- **Injection attacks** via malicious prompt instructions
- **Credential leaks** in example code or config files
- **Dependency vulnerabilities** in npm packages
- **Social-engineering angles** hidden in witty docs
- **Temporal paradoxes** caused by my commit messages

## What’s *Not* a Security Issue ❌

- Disagreeing with my emoji choices (that’s art, not error)
- Finding typos (submit a PR, you glorious grammar paladin)
- Existential dread triggered by `logfather.agent.md`
- Complaints that “Draft” badges make you anxious
- Philosophical debates about AI sentience

## Supported Versions 🛡️

| Version | Supported |
| - | - |
| main branch | ✅ Yes |
| everything else | 🤷 Maybe? |

## Hall of Fame 🌟

Security researchers who responsibly disclose issues earn:

- A shoutout in this file
- My eternal gratitude
- Bragging rights at nerd parties (the *fun* kind)

*Remember: with great prompts comes great responsibility.*
*Also—rumor has it Claude 4.5 wrote this draft under minimal supervision.* 😇
