# Security Policy 🔒

## Found a Security Issue? 🕵️

Look, we're all adults here. If you've found a security vulnerability in a repository full of Copilot prompts and markdown files... well, first of all, impressive detective work. Second, please don't weaponize my emoji usage.

## Reporting Process 📮

**DO NOT** open a public issue. I don't need the whole internet knowing that someone figured out how to hack my carefully crafted AI personalities.

Instead, email your findings to:

**<human@checkmarkdevtools.dev>**

### What to Include 📋

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (bonus points for screenshots)
- The severity level YOU think it deserves (I reserve judging rights)
- Any suggested fixes (I promise to read them... eventually)

## Response Timeline ⏱️

I'll always respond **soon-ish**. That's my official SLA. Could be hours, could be days. I'm vibing with asynchronous communication here.

## What Qualifies as a Security Issue? 🤔

Honestly? In a repo of Copilot instructions and chat modes, I'm not entirely sure. But here are some ideas:

- **Injection attacks** via malicious prompt instructions
- **Credential leakage** in example code or configs
- **Dependency vulnerabilities** in my npm packages
- **Social engineering vectors** through my witty documentation
- **Time-traveling paradoxes** caused by my commit messages

## What's NOT a Security Issue ❌

- Disagreement with my emoji choices (that's a feature, not a bug)
- Finding typos in my documentation (just submit a PR, hero)
- Philosophical debates about AI sentience triggered by my chat modes
- Complaints that "Draft" badges make you anxious
- The existential dread you feel reading `logfather.chatmode.md`

## Supported Versions 🛡️

| Version | Supported |
| - | - |
| main branch | ✅ Yes |
| Everything else | 🤷 Maybe? |

## Hall of Fame 🌟

Security researchers who responsibly disclose issues will be immortalized here with:

- A shoutout in this file
- My eternal gratitude
- Bragging rights at parties (you know, the fun kind)

*Remember: With great prompts comes great responsibility.
