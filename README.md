> 🦄 Hack Time Update: Contest Mode Activated!
>
> I’m off chasing glory in a coding contest through the end of September, 2025, so this repo’s usual hustle is on a quick coffee break. I’ll ninja-drop updates whenever I can between rounds, but please hang tight while I duke it out on the leaderboard.

> Thanks for your patience - and may your builds always pass! 🏅✨

Welcome to my collection of **Custom Instructions, Prompts, and Chat Modes** — your go-to resource for uniquely crafted, obsessively refined GitHub Copilot personalities. These were built for creative chaos, workflow upgrades, and the occasional code emergency.

Every mode here is handwritten by me (with ChatGPT running background triage and GitHub Copilot chiming in like a never-silent backseat driver). I occasionally take inspiration from other sources (always crediting them), but I always put my own spin on things to make them truly unique.

Each entry is clearly labeled by status, so you’ll know if you’re about to deploy a seasoned attending... or an intern who thinks “merge conflict” is a new diagnosis. Use the badges to gauge readiness and stability, then dive into the docs for detailed usage.

Some ideas aren’t fully baked yet — a few are wild concepts still in beta-brainstorm mode, while others are rock-solid and battle-tested in my daily workflow. Either way, everything’s clearly marked so you know exactly what you’re getting into. Check out the [Status Lifecycle & Badges](./docs/status-badge-lifecycle.md) for the full rundown.

> 🦄 If things start to feel a little wild, just remember: it’s not quite _The Pitt_... but I do like to keep you on your toes!

## 💥 Sparked It. Shaped It. Shoutouts.

> 🦄 This project isn’t fully baked yet - it’s somewhere between “I might be onto something” and “what if I made it do _this_ too?”
> But from the beginning, a few people showed up, encouraged the madness, and gave me room to run wild just to test a theory.
>
> **Thank you** for your ideas, your encouragement, your feedback, and for listening during all the times _I wouldn’t shut up about it!_ These shoutouts are for you. 🥰

### 🕹️ Courtney

For jumping into early testing with zero hesitation, breaking everything in sight (in the best way), and somehow still being excited to tell others about it. I appreciate the feedback, the encouragement, and your willingness to _poke the bear_ to make things better.
Your early involvement helps shape what this will become - **thank you** for being part of the chaos.

### 🧨 Vijaya

**Thank you** for planting the original idea that I immediately ran with, rewired, and reimagined into something you probably don’t even recognize - but it's still firmly rooted in your vision of what _useful_ actually looks like.
Your influence, clarity, and push for building things that scale across teams lit the fuse. This entire project is built on that spark and simply wouldn’t exist without you.

# 📚 The `.github/` Directory

Welcome to the heart of this repository’s GitHub automation, documentation, and creative workflow tools. This folder contains the essential resources and configuration files that power collaboration, automation, and custom Copilot experiences across the project.

Whether you’re looking for unique Copilot personalities, reusable prompt templates, or detailed instructions for contributors and bots, you’ll find the entry points here. For the full library of modes, prompts, and instructions, see the [`docs/`](./docs/) folder.

Each document is clearly labeled by status (see [Status Lifecycle & Badges](./docs/status-badge-lifecycle.md)), so you’ll know if you’re about to deploy a seasoned attending... or an intern who thinks “merge conflict” is a new diagnosis.

## 🤹 Custom Instructions

This is where the magic lives — reusable, testable, sometimes over-engineered instructions for GitHub Copilot and other AI agents. These aren’t prompts you paste once and forget — they’re designed to behave like little command-line utilities for your agent.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using VS Code, you can enable custom instructions for Copilot by setting the `⚙️ copilot.customInstructions`field in your settings. If you're _not_ using VS Code... well, you probably know what you're doing and I trust you to handle it.

## 🧑‍🚀 Prompts

These are your spectral conductors — high-level prompts designed for Agent Mode that don’t _do_ the work, they summon the right specialists to do it for them. Think: “raise the Diff Philosopher, call in the Commit Surgeon, validate it all without lifting a mortal finger.”

Each one knows exactly which tools to use (`#changes`, `#editFiles`, `#runInTerminal`) and when to call them. You’re not just generating content — you’re performing a séance on your staging area with precision and a clipboard.

| Name | Status | Purpose | Notes |
| - | :-: | - | - |
| [`generate-commit-message`](./docs/prompts/generate-commit-message.md) | [![Status: Tweak](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-tweak-FB5607.svg)](./docs/prompts/generate-commit-message.md) | Directs Copilot to analyze a git diff, format a conventional commit, validate it, and save to `commit.tmp` | Use Agent Mode for best results. |

> ⭐️ If you tested any of the above modes and it helped you out, leave a star! If it failed spectacularly, let me know and I'll investigate. Check back soon for updates.
