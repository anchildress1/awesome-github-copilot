🚧 WIP: My AI prompts, chat modes & instructions - curated by me (and ChatGPT). Updates often!

Welcome to my collection of Custom Insturctions, Prompts and Chat Modes - your go-to ER for uniquely crafted GitHub Copilot personalities, all designed for creative chaos, workflow upgrades, and occasional code emergencies. Every mode here is handpicked by me (with ChatGPT running triage in the background).

Each one is clearly labeled by status, so you’ll know if you’re about to deploy a seasoned attending... or an intern who thinks “merge conflict” is a new diagnosis.

> 🦄 If things start to feel a little wild, just remember: it’s not quite The Pitt - but we do like to keep you on your toes.

> ⭐️ If you tried a chat mode and it helped you out, leave a star! Check back soon for updates.
